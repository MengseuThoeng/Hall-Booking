Dear teacher....
this program might be confusing when you want to look at the code  because of alot of code in there file 
i failed to create on booking method so i write on main and i don't have much time to recreate i have project to do in my university (C# Windows Appliation) i will improve myself better than this thank you



rule of my program
config row and seat only input 1-9 cannot input -1 or 0 or more 9 especialy can't input the text

booking processing you can only booking maxiumun 3 seats only 
if you book on the available seat (success)
if you use multi seat (a-1,a-2) if the a-1 is already has someone booking the book process end so a-2 still available

like booking not success
